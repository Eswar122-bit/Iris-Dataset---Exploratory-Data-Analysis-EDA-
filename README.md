# Iris-Dataset---Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA-
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Iris dataset using Python. Includes data cleaning, summary statistics, visualizations (histograms, pairplots, boxplots, heatmaps), and insights into class distributions. Built with pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, and scikit-learn for data exploration and visualization.

   📌 Insights

Iris dataset has 3 classes (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica).

Petal measurements are highly effective in classifying species.

Strong correlations observed between petal length & petal width.
